# InternBridge

### InternBridge helps to centralize all the internship related activities of your college

## The problem InternBridge solves

The conventional of announcing the internships in colleges is though mails and notification board. However , it is very common that a students misses to see the mail and notification and thus misses the deadlines. Especially in this time when everything has switched to online mode, all the college related activities are announced through mails. Two of our team members ourselves missed an internship we really wanted just because that mail got dumped under other not so important emails.
This lead to the idea of creation of an online college portal exclusively for internships. With InternBridge, we aim to centralize all the internship related activities of the college at a single place and to maximize the effective reach. It helps the faculty to easily add internship opportunities and the students to get them all at one place and also filter them as per their skills and need.

## Challenges we ran into

- faced issues with user authorization, solved it finally after thoroughly going through the documentation
- weren't satisfied with the overall design of the website...so redesigned it using Material UI
- used functional components initially in React, but had to later change them all to class components due to the need of the situation

## Technologies we used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Material-UIReact.js
